This repository is for sharing org-wide Github metadata and workflow templates.

Some files (if not all) in this directory get automagically synced to other
Knative, so when adding new files, make sure to include a note below to
templates about this. The syncing is done by
[knobots](https://github.com/mattmoor/knobots).

```yaml
# This file is automagically synced here from github.com/knative-sandbox/.github
# repo by knobots: https://github.com/mattmoor/knobots and will be overwritten.
```
